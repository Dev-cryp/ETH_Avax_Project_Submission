# Degen Gaming Token - ERC20 on Avalanche 

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to create an ERC20 token and deploy it on the Avalanche network for **Degen Gaming**. The token will be used as a reward mechanism for players, allowing them to earn, transfer, and redeem tokens for in-game items. The smart contract includes the following functionality:

- **Minting new tokens**: Only the owner can mint new tokens and distribute them as rewards to players.
- **Transferring tokens**: Players can transfer tokens to other players.
- **Redeeming tokens**: Players can redeem tokens for in-game store items.
- **Checking token balance**: Players can view their token balance at any time.
- **Burning tokens**: Players can burn tokens they own that are no longer needed.

### Contract Details
- **Name**: Degen Gaming
- **Symbol**: Degen
- **Decimals**: 10
- **Total Supply**: Dynamically increases as tokens are minted.
  
### Functionality

1. **Minting Tokens**  
   The owner of the contract can mint new tokens and assign them to a specific player. This increases the total supply of tokens.

2. **Transferring Tokens**  
   Players can transfer tokens to other players as long as they have enough balance.

3. **Burning Tokens**  
   Players can burn tokens they no longer need, which decreases their balance and the total token supply.

4. **Redeeming Tokens for In-Game Items**  
   Players can use their tokens to redeem items from the in-game store. A set of predefined items is initialized with a price, and the playerâ€™s balance is deducted when they redeem an item.

5. **Checking Balance**  
   Players can check their token balance anytime by calling the `balanceOf` function.

### Store Items
The game store has predefined items available for purchase with tokens. The contract initializes the following items:
- **Bag**: 500 tokens
- **Tablet**: 1,000 tokens
- **Air Mac**: 20,000 tokens
- **Monkey NFT**: 25,000 tokens

## How to Deploy
1. Compile and deploy the `DegenGaming` contract on the Avalanche C-Chain.
2. Once deployed, use the contract's functions to mint tokens, transfer tokens, redeem items, and manage the token supply.

## How to Use
- **Minting Tokens**: Only the contract owner can call the `mint` function.
- **Transferring Tokens**: Players can call the `transfer` function to send tokens to another address.
- **Burning Tokens**: Call the `burn` function to destroy tokens from your balance.
- **Redeeming Items**: Call the `Itemredeem` function to redeem a specific item using its ID.
- **Check Balance**: Use `balanceOf` to view your token balance.
